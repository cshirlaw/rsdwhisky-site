      intro="RSD Whisky is an independent Scottish whisky business based in Edinburgh, the home of Scotch."

      <p>
        We work within Scotland&apos;s long-developed network of brokers,
        blenders, bottlers and whisky specialists. These are people who work
        with Scotch whisky every day — assessing spirit, approving samples,
        maintaining brands and keeping the industry moving with the times. It is
        the part of the Scotch world most people never see, where casks are
        exchanged, samples are approved, brands are maintained and new ones
        planned, and where decisions are made quickly.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our capabilities cover bulk Scotch whisky supply and Scotch brands for
        export, as well as prestige bottlings for selected clients. We keep our
        overheads low so that value goes into the whisky itself — maximising
        quality for the price, rather than paying for heavy administration or
        large bureaucracies.
      </p>

      <p>
        We work with experienced people across the independent Scotch sector who
        understand how to shape whisky character and maintain the consistency
        that supports a strong brand. Brands are what sustain the Scotch whisky
        business.
      </p>

      <p>
        We also work on a new development: ready-to-drink spirit mixes, created
        with the same practical approach and focus on value.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some companies operate at global scale — William Grant &amp; Sons,
        Diageo and others. They do it well. Our strength lies elsewhere: in
        Scottish independence, deep industry experience and offering the best
        value possible to the retailers and drinkers who choose our products.
        Those who manage to find and enjoy our whiskies will know they are
        getting something honest, well made and a little more exclusive.
