      intro="RSD Whisky is an independent Scottish whisky business based in Edinburgh, the home of Scotch and where blending first began."

      <p>
        We work within Scotland&apos;s long-developed network of brokers,
        blenders, bottlers and whisky experts. These are the people who nose,
        taste and assess whisky every day, and who keep the industry moving with
        the times. It is the part of the Scotch world that most people never
        see, where casks are traded, samples are lined up, blends are created
        and decisions are made quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our work covers bulk Scotch whisky, own-label brands, prestige
        bottlings and canned ready-to-drink spirit mixes. We keep central
        overheads low, so most of the cost goes into the quality of the whisky
        and the liquid in the can, rather than into layers of administration.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are not a multinational and do not pretend to be. Large groups such
        as Diageo, Pernod Ricard, Edrington, William Grant &amp; Sons and Beam
        Suntory operate at global scale and do it well. Our strength lies
        elsewhere: in Scottish independence, in deep industry experience, and in
        fair value for the retailers and drinkers who choose our products.
